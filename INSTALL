SDP-Solvers
------------
You will need at least one of the following:
1) CSDP
   $ cd src/third_party/Csdp-6.0.1
   $ make
2) DSDP
   -> get debian package via apt-get
3) SDPA
   first, make sure you have ATLAS/BLAS installed
   $ cd src/third_party/sdpa-7.1.1/
   $ ./configure --with-blas="-latlas"

   more help is available here:

Finally, run cmake, it will detect the installed libraries 
and compile the wrappers as needed.
